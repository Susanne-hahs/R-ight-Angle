## Introduction 

The objective of this project was to investigate how the Force-Length relationship of muscles is affected by their fatigue status, comparing non-fatigued (control) and fatigued conditions. The aim was to determine if there was a significant alteration in the angle at which the maximum isometric force is generated. Previous research has shown a relationship between fatigued and a shift to the right in this angle, suggesting that fatigued muscles tend to exert more force at longer lengths (i will insert a paper here). To further explore this association and validate this hypothesis, we collected and analyzed comprehensive data on maximum voluntary contractions from a class-wide sample, examining both fatigued and non-fatigued muscle conditions to ascertain whether our data set also exhibited a similar rightward shift.

## Methods 

In order to assess the effect of eccentric fatigue of elbow flexor muscles we measured isometric force over the range of motion of the forearm produced by MVC. In order to obtain MVC data we designed and constructed a portable Arduino-based force-data acquisition system (DAQ).

1. DAQ Design components

100-kg S-type Load cell with HX711 amplifier 

Arduino Uno microcontroller 

2. Data Collection Elbow angle 

Constructed a ganiometer. Then, found the center of the elbow joint in lateral view and marked this position with a marker. From that point, we marked a line along the lateral margin of the radius. We then poked a hole through the center of the ganiometer to affix it to the upper arm so that the center aligns with the mark at the elbow and the 0-180angle axis aligns with the long axis of the humerus. 

3. Data Collection Isometric MVCs

Then, in order to use the ganiometer to collect isometric force data from MVCs over 12 arm angles, 45-157.5angles at 11.25angle intervals, we collected control (non-fatigued) data from the largest arm angle of 157.5. We moved through the 12 arm angles by rotating our bodies about the hips. 

4. Data Collection MVCs after Eccentric Fatigue 

To eccentrically fatigue our forearm flexors, we performed isokenetic controlled drops of a heavy weight object weighing 1/3 of our maximum isometric force recorded in the control experiment. We repeated the exercise for 3 minutes. Then, we waited 2 minutes before performing the experiment exactly the same as we did for the control data. 

### Summary of Experimental Protocol

1. Fabricate and program a load-cell data acquisition system.

2. Make a ganiometer.

3. Record isometric MVCs at 12 distinct elbow angles. (un-fatigued data)

4. Eccentrically fatigue flexors.

5. Wait 2 minutes.

6. Repeat recording isometric MVCs at the same 12 distinct elbow angles (fatigued data)


## Results 

```{r reading in data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

f <- list.files("new_data", pattern = ".csv", full.names=TRUE)
f

dat.l <- list()

for(i in f){
  met.dat<- unlist(strsplit(i,"_"))
  who <- met.dat[3]
  activity <- met.dat[4]
  ang <- gsub(".csv","", met.dat[5])
  dat.l[[i]]<- read_csv(i) %>%
    mutate(who = who, angle = ang, activity = activity)
}

dat <- do.call(rbind,dat.l)
print(dat)
